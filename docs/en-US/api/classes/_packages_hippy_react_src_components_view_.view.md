# Class: View

The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout
with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. `View` maps directly to
the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is
a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

View is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.
