# Getting Started

Hippy uses `monorepo` for code management to unify the versions of multiple repository SDK. The front-end can directly introduce the corresponding NPM package, and the native can access it through publishing branch source code or through the corresponding package management repository.

Hippy already provides a complete [front-end and native paradigm](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples) to start App development directly based on our existing paradigm.

---

# Quick Start

## Preparing environment

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/), [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed locally.

!> npm required minimum version v7, nodejs required minimum version v16

Run `git clone https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy.git` and `npm install` at project root directory.

!> The Hippy repository applies [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage so,gz,otf files, make sure you have installed [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) first.

For macOS developers:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with iOS sdk: build the iOS app.
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/): Used to manage iOS project files.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.

For Windows developers:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.

## Build the iOS App with js demo

For iOS, we recommend to use iOS simulator when first try. However, you can change the Xcode configuration to install the app to iPhone if you are an iOS expert.

1. Execute the command in the Hippy root directory

   ```bash
   npm run init
  
   # This command consists of `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap && npm run build`, you can also execute these commands separately.
   #
   # npm install: Script dependencies required to install the project.
   #
   # `npx lerna bootstrap`: Install the dependencies of each JS package. (Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multiple js packages)
   #
   # `npm run build`: Build each JS SDK package.
   ```

2. Choose a JS Demo you want to experience, and execute it in the root directory of the Hippy project

   ```bash
   npm run buildexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]

   # Select the JS Demo you want to build in the square brackets. After execution, the corresponding JS-related resource files will be generated to the terminal Demo directory.

   # If there is an exception in this step, you can also `cd` to any JS Demo directory under `examples`, and execute `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install the dependencies of Demo.
   ```

3. Open the `examples/ios-demo` directory, use `Cocoapods` to generate project files

   ```bash
   cd examples/ios-demo
   pod install
   ```

4. Use `Xcode` to open the `HippyDemo.xcworkspace` project file generated by Cocoapods in the previous step to build the iOS App.

> For more details, please refer to [iOS integration chapter](ios/integration).

## Build the Android app with js demo

1. Run `npm run init` at root directory.

   > This command is combined with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap && npm run build`.
   >
   > `npm install`: Install the project build scripts dependencies.
   >
   > `npx lerna bootstrap`: Install dependencies of each npm package.（Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multi js packages）
   >
   > `npm run build`: Build each front-end sdk package.

2. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]` at root directory.
3. Open `Android Project` at root directory with Android Studio.
4. Connect Android phone with USB cable and make sure USB debugging mode is enabled(Run `adb devices` on the computer terminal to check cellphone connection status).
5. Open the project with Android Studio, run and install the apk.

> If `Step 2` throw error, you can `cd` to `examples` different js demo directory, and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install demo dependencies first.
>
> More details for [Android Integration](android/integration).

## Debug the js demo

1. Follow `Build the iOS App with js demo` or `Build the Android app with js demo` first to build the App.
2. Run `npm run init:example [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]` at root directory.
3. Run `npm run debugexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo] dev` at root directory.

> Or you can `cd` to `examples` different js demo directory to run `npm run hippy:dev` instead.
>
> On example debug mode, npm packages such as @hippy/react, @hippy/vue, @hippy/vue-next are linked to `packages` > `[different package]` > `dist`(not node_modules), so if you have changed js package source code and want to make it take effect in target example, please call `npm run build` at root directory again.
>
> More details for debugging can be read in [Hippy Debug Document](guide/debug).

## Build the js production demo

1. Follow `Build the iOS App with js demo` or `Build the Android app with js demo` first to build the App.
2. `cd` to examples `hippy-react-demo` or `hippy-vue-demo` or `hippy-vue-next-demo`.
3. Run `npm install` to install demo js dependencies.
4. Run `npm run hippy:vendor` and `npm run hippy:build` in sequence to build the production `vendor.[android|ios].js` and `index.[android|ios].js`.

> Hippy demo uses Webpack DllPlugin to split the js common chunk and app chunk, which enables different business reuse common code.

# Native Integration

If you want to access Hippy to an existing native project, refer to the [Android Integration](android/integration.md) and [iOS Integration](ios/integration.md) tutorials.

# Front-end Integration

Hippy supports both React and Vue UI frameworks, which are implemented through the [@hippy/react](//www.npmjs.com/package/@hippy/react) and [@hippy/vue](//www.npmjs.com/package/@hippy/vue) packages.

## hippy-react

[[hippy-react introduces]](hippy-react/introduction.md) [[example project]](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples/hippy-react-demo)

The hippy-react project can only be initialized by manual configuration for the time being. It is recommended to directly clone the demo project and modify it based on it.

Of course, you can also configure it from scratch.

### Preparing hippy-react runtime dependencies

use `npm i` to install the following npm packages.

| Package name                | Description                          |
| ------------------- |--------------------------------------|

| regenerator-runtime | async/await transformation runtime   |

### Prepare hippy-react compile time dependencies

Take the official [example project](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples/hippy-react-demo) as an example, you need to use `npm i -D` to prepare the following dependencies. Of course, developers can choose according to their needs:

### hippy-react compile configuration

At present, hippy-react is `Webpack 4` built, and the configuration is all placed in the [scripts](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts) directory. In fact, it is only the configuration file of [webpack](//webpack.js.org/). It is recommended to read  the contents of  [webpack](//webpack.js.org/)'s official website first, and then modify it after having a certain foundation.

#### hippy-react development and debugging configuration

This configuration shows a minimal configuration for running Hippy on the native.

| Configuration file                                                     | Description       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [hippy-webpack.dev.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/hippy-webpack.dev.js) |Configuration for debugging|

#### hippy-react production configuration

There are two main differences between production packages and development and debugging packages:

1. Turn on production mode, remove debug information, and turn off `watch` (watch mode listens for file changes and repackages).
2. More than one Hippy business is likely to run in the native, so the shared part is separated into a `vendor` package, which can effectively reduce the volume of the business package. [DllPlugin](//webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/) and [DllReferencePlugin](//webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/#dllreferenceplugin) are used to realize this.

| Configuration file                                                     | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [vendor.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/vendor.js) | Shared parts that need to be included in the vendor package |
| [hippy-webpack.ios.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/hippy-webpack.ios.js) | iOS business package configuration                           |
| [hippy-webpack.ios-vendor.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/hippy-webpack.ios-vendor.js) | iOS vendor package configuration                            |
| [hippy-webpack.android.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/hippy-webpack.android.js) | Android business package configuration                       |
| [hippy-webpack.android-vendor.js](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/scripts/hippy-webpack.android-vendor.js) | Android vendor package configuration                        |

If you carefully observe the Webpack configuration, you can see that the configuration of iOS and Android is not much different. However, due to the influence of Apple policy, only [JavaScript core](//developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)(hereinafter referred to as JSC) can be used as the running environment on iOS, and JSC follows the iOS system and can not be upgraded independently. JSC with lower version iOS can not even fully support ES6, so you need to output a copy of JS code of ES5 version. Android can use the V8 in the independently upgraded [X5](//x5.tencent.com/) as the running environment, and you can directly use ES6 code.

!> **Special note:** the syntax that JS can use is affected by the minimum version covered by iOS. Most capabilities can be `@babel/preset-env` automatically installed by polyfill, but some features are not available. For example, if you want to use [Proxy](//caniuse.com/#feat=proxy), you can not cover iOS 10 and below.

### hippy-react entry file

The entry file is very simple, just initializing a Hippy instance from the hippy-react. Note that the entry file component needs to be wrapped by a single node, as follows:

```js
import { Hippy } from '@hippy/react';
import App from './app';

new Hippy({
  appName: 'Demo',  // Business name assigned by native
  entryPage: App,   //  Corresponding to the component when the business is started
  silent: false,    // Set to true to turn off the framework log output
}).start();

// P.S. The entrypage needs to be wrapped by a single node and cannot be in the form of an array, for example:
import React from 'react';
import {
    View,
    Text,
} from '@hippy/react';
export default function app() {
    // Do not use this form for entry files. Non entry files can be used
    return [
        <View key="root_blk" />,
        <Text key="root_txt">test test</Text>
    ];
    // Modified to wrap through single node
    return (<View>
            <View key="root_blk" />,
            <Text key="root_txt">test test</Text>
        </View>);
}

```

### hippy-react npm script

A few npm scripts with `hippy:` are provided in [package.json](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-react-demo/package.json#L13) which can start [@hippy/debug-server-next](//www.npmjs.com/package/@hippy/debug-server-next) devtools.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "hippy:dev": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js hippy-dev --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.dev.js",
    "hippy:vendor": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js webpack --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.ios-vendor.js --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.android-vendor.js",
    "hippy:build": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js webpack --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.ios.js --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.android.js"
  }
```

### hippy-react to Web

Please refer to the special [hippy-react to Web section](hippy-react/web.md).

## hippy-vue

[[hippy-vue introduces](hippy-vue/introduction.md) [[example project]](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples/hippy-vue-demo)

The hippy-vue is relatively simple. The hippy-vue is just the rendering layer of [Vue](//vuejs.org) on the native, and the components are basically consistent with the browser. You can [create a Web project](//cli.vuejs.org/zh/guide/creating-a-project.html) through the [vue-cli](//cli.vuejs.org/), and then add some hippy-vue content to render the web page directly to the native.

### Prepare hippy-vue runtime dependencies

Please use to `npm i` install the following npm packages to ensure proper working.

| Package name                        | Description                                |
| --------------------------- |--------------------------------------------|

### hippy-vue entry file

The project initialized by hippy pocket cli has its own [Web portal file](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-vue-demo/src/main.js), which can be reserved for starting Web pages. However, due to the different startup parameters of hippy-vue, a special [native entry files](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-vue-demo/src/main-native.js) are required to load some modules used on the native.

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import HippyVueNativeComponents from '@hippy/vue-native-components';
import App from './app.vue';
import routes from './routes';
import { setApp } from './util';

// The output of framework debugging information is prohibited. It can be used after uncommenting.
// Vue.config.silent = true;

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

// Hippy native component extension middleware can use native extension components such as modal, view pager, tab host and UL refresh.
Vue.use(HippyVueNativeComponents);
Vue.use(VueRouter);

const router = new VueRouter(routes);

/**
 * Declare an app, which is generated synchronously
 */
const app = new Vue({
  // App name specified by the native
  appName: 'Demo',
  // The root node must be ID. the screen will be triggered when the root node is mounted
  rootView: '#root',
  // Render oneself
  render: h => h(App),
  // Status bar configuration under iPhone
  iPhone: {
    // Status bar configuration
    statusBar: {
      // Disable auto fill of status bar
      // disabled: true,

      // If the background color of the status bar is not matched, 4282431619 will be used, that is #40b883 - Vue green
      // Because the runtime only supports the actual conversion of styles and attributes, you need to convert the color values in advance with the following converter, which can be run directly in the node.
      // hippy-vue-css-loader/src/compiler/style/color-parser.js
      backgroundColor: 4283416717,

      // The background image of the status bar. Note that this will be stretched according to the size of the container.
      // backgroundImage: '//mat1.gtimg.com/www/qq2018/imgs/qq_logo_2018x2.png',
    },
  },
  // router
  router,
});

/**
 * $start is the callback triggered after Hippy starts
 * Vue will finish rendering the first screen of VDOM before Hippy starts, so the first screen performance is very high
 * In $start, you can notify the native that the startup has been completed and start sending messages to the front-end.
 */
app.$start((/* app */) => {
  // Here are some things that need to be done after Hippy starts, such as notifying the native that the front-end is ready to start sending messages.
  // setApp(app);
});

/**
 * Save the app to accept events from the native through the app later.
 *
 * It was put in $start before, but there is a problem. Because the execution of $start is too slow,
 * if getapp() is used on the home page, it may lead to undefined and listening failure. So I moved it out.
 *
 * However, the native event still needs to wait until $start, that is, after the hippy is started, 
 * because the front bridge has not been established and the front-end of the native message cannot be accepted.
 */
setApp(app);
```

### hippy-vue npm script

A few npm scripts with `hippy:` are provided in [package.json](//github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/examples/hippy-vue-demo/package.json#L13) which can start [@hippy/debug-server-next](//www.npmjs.com/package/@hippy/debug-server-next) devtools.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "hippy:dev": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js hippy-dev --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.dev.js",
    "hippy:vendor": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js webpack --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.ios-vendor.js --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.android-vendor.js",
    "hippy:build": "node ./scripts/env-polyfill.js webpack --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.ios.js --config ./scripts/hippy-webpack.android.js"
  },
```

### Routing

`@hippy/vue-router` fully supports the jump function in vue-router. Please refer to the [hippy-vue](hippy-vue/router.md) document for details.
