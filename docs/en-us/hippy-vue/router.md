# Router

Vue-router implements [@hippy/vue-router](//www.npmjs.com/package/@hippy/vue-router) by slightly modifying the official router and provides the same interface.

The documentation can be directly referenced: [vue-router official website](//router.vuejs.org/).

Animations for page switching are not supported because the `<transition>` component is not yet implemented.
