[section:ReadHandler Read handler requirements]

A read handler must meet the requirements for a [link
asio.reference.Handler handler]. A value `h` of a read handler class
should work correctly in the expression `h(ec, s)`, where `ec` is an lvalue of
type `const error_code` and `s` is an lvalue of type `const size_t`.
