 *
 * For example, in ModuleName.m:
 *
 * - (void)doSomething:(NSString *)aString withA:(NSInteger)a andB:(NSInteger)b
 * { ... }

 * HIPPY_EXPORT_METHOD(doSomething:(NSString *)aString

 *
 * ## Promises
 *
 * Bridge modules can also define methods that are exported to JavaScript as
 * methods that return a Promise, and are compatible with JS async functions.
 *
 * Declare the last two parameters of your native method to be a resolver block
 * and a rejecter block. The resolver block must precede the rejecter block.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * HIPPY_EXPORT_METHOD(doSomethingAsync:(NSString *)aString
 *                           resolver:(HippyPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
 *                           rejecter:(HippyPromiseRejectBlock)reject
 * { ... }
 *
 * Calling `NativeModules.ModuleName.doSomethingAsync(aString)` from
 * JavaScript will return a promise that is resolved or rejected when your
 * native method implementation calls the respective block.
 *
