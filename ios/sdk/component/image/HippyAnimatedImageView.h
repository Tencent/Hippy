@class HippyAnimatedImage;
//
//  An `HippyAnimatedImageView` can take an `HippyAnimatedImage` and plays it automatically when in view hierarchy and stops when removed.
//  The animation can also be controlled with the `UIImageView` methods `-start/stop/isAnimating`.
//  It is a fully compatible `UIImageView` subclass and can be used as a drop-in component to work with existing code paths expecting to display a `UIImage`.
//  Under the hood it uses a `CADisplayLink` for playback, which can be inspected with `currentFrame` & `currentFrameIndex`.
//
@interface HippyAnimatedImageView : UIImageView

// Setting `[UIImageView.image]` to a non-`nil` value clears out existing `animatedImage`.
// And vice versa, setting `animatedImage` will initially populate the `[UIImageView.image]` to its `posterImage` and then start animating and hold `currentFrame`.

// To keep scrolling smooth on single-core devices such as iPhone 3GS/4 and iPod Touch 4th gen, the default run loop mode is NSDefaultRunLoopMode. Otherwise, the default is NSDefaultRunLoopMode.
