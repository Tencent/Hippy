//  An `HippyAnimatedImage`'s job is to deliver frames in a highly performant way and works in conjunction with `HippyAnimatedImageView`.
//  It subclasses `NSObject` and not `UIImage` because it's only an "image" in the sense that a sea lion is a lion.
//  It tries to intelligently choose the frame cache size depending on the image and memory situation with the goal to lower CPU usage for smaller ones, lower memory usage for larger ones and always deliver frames for high performant play-back.
//  Note: `posterImage`, `size`, `loopCount`, `delayTimes` and `frameCount` don't change after successful initialization.
