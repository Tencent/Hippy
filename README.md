## Introduction

Hippy is a cross-platform development framework, aiming to help developers write once, run on three platforms(iOS, Android and Web). Hippy is quite friendly to Web developers, especially who are familiar with React or Vue. With Hippy, developers are able to create the cross platform app easily.

Hippy is now applied in 27+ [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/) apps such as Mobile QQ, Mobile QQ Browser, Tencent Video App, QQ Music App, Tencent News, reaching hundreds of millions of ordinary users.

## Advantages

* Designed for Web developers, officially support Web frameworks like `React` and `Vue`.
* Same APIs for different platforms.
* Excellent performance with JS engine binding communication.
* Build-in recyclable component with better performance.
* Smoothly and gracefully migrate to Web browser.
* Fully supported Flex [Layout engine](./layout).

## Getting started

### Preparing environment

For macOS developers:

1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with iOS sdk: build the iOS app.
2. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.
3. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.

[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended to install the dependencies.

For Windows developers:

1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.
2. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.

> Windows can't run the iOS development environment so far.

### Build the iOS simulator with js demo

For iOS, we recommend to use iOS simulator when first try. However, you can change the Xcode configuration to install the app to iPhone if you are an iOS expert.

1. Install the project build scripts dependencies at root directory with `npm install`.
2. Install dependencies of each npm package at root directory with `lerna bootstrap`.
   （Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multi js packages, if `lerna` command is not found, execute `npm install lerna -g` first.）
3. Build each front-end sdk package at root directory with `npm run build`.
4. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample -- [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo]` at root directory.
5. Start the Xcode and build the iOS app with `open examples/ios-demo/HippyDemo.xcodeproj`.

> If `Step 4` throw error, you can `cd` to `examples` hippy-react-demo or hippy-vue-demo, and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install demo dependencies first.

### Build the Android app with js demo

For Android, we recommend using the real cellphone for better develop experience, because Hippy is using [X5](https://x5.tencent.com/) JS engine which can't support x86 simulator, as well as ARM simulator has a low performance.

Before build the android app, please make sure the SDK and NDK is installed, And *DO NOT* update the build toolchain.

1. Install the whole project dependencies at root directory with `npm install`.
2. Install dependencies of each npm package at root directory with `lerna bootstrap`.
   （Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multi js packages, if `lerna` command is not found, execute `npm install lerna -g` first.）
3. Build each front-end sdk package at root directory with `npm run build`.
4. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample -- [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo]` at root directory.
5. Open the `examples/android-demo` with Android Studio.
6. Connect Android phone with USB cable and make sure USB debugging mode is enabled(Run `adb devices` on the computer terminal to check cellphone connection status).
7. Open the project with Android Studio, run and install the apk.

> If `Step 4` throw error, you can `cd` to `examples` hippy-react-demo or hippy-vue-demo, and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install demo dependencies first.
>
> If you encounter the issue of `No toolchains found in the NDK toolchains folder for ABI with prefix: mips64el-linux-android`, here is the [solution](https://github.com/google/filament/issues/15#issuecomment-415423557).
> [Android SDK integration](https://hippyjs.org/#/android/integration?id=android-%e9%9b%86%e6%88%90)

### Debug the js demo

1. Follow [Build the iOS simulator with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-ios-simulator-with-js-demo) or [Build the Android app with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-android-app-with-js-demo) first to build the App.
2. `cd` to `examples` hippy-react-demo or hippy-vue-demo.
3. Run `npm install` to install demo js dependencies.
4. Run `npm run hippy:dev` and `npm run hippy:debug` respectively to start the live debug mode.

> On example debug mode, npm packages such as @hippy/react, @hippy/vue are linked to `packages` > `[different package]` > `dist`(not node_modules), so if you have changed js package source code and want to make it take effect in target example, please call `npm run build` at root directory again.
>
> More details for debug can be read in [Hippy Debug Document](https://hippyjs.org/#/guide/debug).
