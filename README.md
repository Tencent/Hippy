## Introduction

Hippy is a cross-platform development framework, aiming to help developers write once, run on three platforms(iOS, Android and Web). Hippy is quite friendly to web developers, especially who are familar with React or Vue. With Hippy, developers are able to create the cross platform app easily.

Hippy is now applied in 18 [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/) apps concerning tens of billions of ordinary users.

## Advantages

* Design for web developers, offically support web frameworks like `React` and `Vue`.
* Same APIs for different platforms.
* Excellent performance with JS engine binding communication.
* Build-in recyclable component with better performance.
* Smoothly and gracefully migrate to web browser.
* Fully supported Flex [Layout engine](./layout).

## Getting started

### Preparing environment

For macOS developers:

1. [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with iOS sdk: build the iOS app.
2. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/AndroidStudio) with NDK: build the android app.
3. [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.

[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended to install the dependencies.

For Windows developers:

1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/AndroidStudio) with NDK: build the android app.
2. [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.

*Windows can't run the iOS development environment so far.*

### Build your first Hippy app

### Start the iOS simulator with hippy-react or hippy-vue demo

For iOS we recommend to use iOS simulator when first try, however, you may change the Xcode configuration to install the app to iPhone if you are a iOS expert.

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Build the front-end sdk packages with `npm run build`.
3. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample -- [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo]`.
4. Start the Xcode and build the iOS app with `open examples/ios-demo/HippyDemo.xcodeproj`.

### Start the android app with hippy-react or hippy-vue demo

For Android we recommend to use the real cellphone for better experience, because Hippy is using [X5](https://x5.tencent.com/) JS engine which can't support x86 simulator, as well as ARM simulator has a low performance.

Before build the android app, please make sure the SDK and NDK is installed, And *DO NOT* update the build toolchain.

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Build the front-end sdk packages with `npm run build`.
3. Start `ConEmu` with git shell, then build the hippy-react demo with `npm run buildexample -- hippy-react-demo`, or build the hippy-vue demo with `npm run buildexample -- hippy-vue-demo` .
4. Open the `examples/android-demo` with Android Studio.
5. Connect android phone with USB cable and make sure USB debugging mode and USB installation are enabled.
6. Open the project with Android Studio, run and install the apk...

> For Windows Developers: Because Hippy example build script is writen with `bash`. Here's the [ConEmnu](https://conemu.github.io/) with git shell recommended, it is provided the Linux environment for Windows.

> If you encought the issue of `No toolchains found in the NDK toolchains folder for ABI with prefix: mips64el-linux-android`, here is the [solution](https://github.com/google/filament/issues/15#issuecomment-415423557).
