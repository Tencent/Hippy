# Ensure the origin of an attribution trigger redirect is trustworthy

An attribution was not recorded because the origin of the attribution trigger redirect was
not trustworthy. For a redirect of the form `https://<attributionreportto>/.well-known/attribution-reporting/trigger-attribution[?data=<data>]`, the `<attributionreportto>` origin must be trustworthy.
